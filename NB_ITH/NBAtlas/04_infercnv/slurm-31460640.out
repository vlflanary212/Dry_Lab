Error in checkNumberOfLocalWorkers(workers) : 
  Attempting to set up 16 localhost parallel workers with only 1 CPU cores available for this R process (per ‘/proc/self/status’), which could result in a 1600% load. The hard limit is set to 300%. Overusing the CPUs has negative impact on the current R process, but also on all other processes of yours and others running on the same machine. See help("parallelly.options", package = "parallelly") for how to override the soft and hard limits
